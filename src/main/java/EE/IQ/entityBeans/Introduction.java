    /*
        An entity bean (entity) is the fundamental persistence object in the Java Persistence API (JPA). Entities are used
        to relate java classes to tables in a relational database. There isn't anything fundamentally different about an
        entity class in terms of the code that you write. An entity is a plain old java object(POJO), and it follows the
        same rules that apply to all java classes.

        There are a few requirements for entity classes, they are:
            Entity metadata, that we can use in two ways, annotations or XML, but we use annotations almost exclusively.
            Fields and properties,

        POJO: is a regular Java object that doesn't require any specific restrictions or extensions. It's a simple class
        that encapsulates data and provides basic functionality without having to adhere to any special frameworks or
        inherit from specific classes/interfaces. POJOs are often used for their simplicity and ease of maintenance in
        Java programming.
