        ### Maven Wrappers

            Are scripts used in the maven ecosystem that allow
            to execute maven without installing it on your machine. To install that
            on your project just type mvn wrapper:wrapper and maven will download it for
            you.

            mvnw: linux and macos
            mvnw.cmd: windows

            $ mvnw <desired command>

        ### Library

            A library in Java typically refers to a collection of precompiled classes, often distributed in JAR (Java ARchive) files. These classes provide reusable functionalities that can be utilized by a Java application. Libraries contain code that developers can call upon to perform specific tasks or access specific functionalities within their own code. Examples of libraries include Apache Commons, Google Guava, or third-party libraries that provide specific functionalities like JSON parsing, database connectivity, etc.

        ### Plugin

            A plugin, on the other hand, is an add-on or an extension that augments the functionality of a tool or software. In the Maven context, plugins are used to extend or customize the build process. Maven plugins execute specific goals (tasks) during the build lifecycle. They can perform various tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, deploying to a server, and more. Maven plugins are configured within the pom.xml file and are invoked during different phases of the Maven build lifecycle.
