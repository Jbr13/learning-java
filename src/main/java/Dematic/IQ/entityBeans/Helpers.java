    * Fields and properties
    *   In Java, there's a subtle difference between the terms "field" and "property." A field refers to an instance variable
    *   (or member) of a class but not to its getter and setter methods (if the field has them). A property is the combination
    *   of an instance variable and its associated getter and setter methods. When you add annotations for fields or properties,
    *   you add them to the member variable, not to the associated getter or setter method.
