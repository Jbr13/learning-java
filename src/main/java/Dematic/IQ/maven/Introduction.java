        Maven is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of managing a software project's build, dependencies,
        testing, and deployment. It uses a standardized project structure and a declarative XML file called
        pom.xml (Project Object Model) to define project configuration, dependencies, and build settings.

        Key Functionalities of Maven:

            Dependency Management: Maven manages project dependencies by fetching libraries and dependencies from repositories,
            both local and remote. It automatically resolves transitive dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries are
            available during the build process.

            Project Build Lifecycle: Maven defines a series of build phases (clean, compile, test, package, etc.) that define
            the sequence of tasks needed to build a project. It follows a standard build lifecycle, simplifying the build process.

            Convention over Configuration: Maven follows conventions, allowing projects to have a standard directory
            structure (src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.) and naming conventions. This helps in easily understanding and
            navigating different projects.

            Plugins: Maven uses plugins to extend its functionalities. There are various plugins available for different tasks
            like compiling code, running tests, generating reports, deploying artifacts, etc.

            Project Reporting: Maven generates project reports (such as code coverage reports, test reports, and static analysis
            reports) to provide insights into the project's health and status.

            Build Profiles: Maven supports build profiles that allow you to define different build configurations for different
            environments or purposes (e.g., development, testing, production).

            Reproducible Builds: Maven ensures reproducible builds by specifying project dependencies, versions, and configurations
            explicitly in the pom.xml file. This helps in maintaining consistency across different build environments.

            Basic Maven Workflow: Create a pom.xml file that defines the project configuration, dependencies, plugins, and build settings.
            Run Maven commands (mvn clean install, mvn compile, mvn test, etc.) to execute different phases of the build lifecycle.

        Benefits of Using Maven:
            Simplifies project setup and management.
            Standardizes project structure and build process.
            Manages dependencies and handles transitive dependencies automatically.
            Enhances collaboration and consistency across projects.
