        Hibernate is a popular open-source Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies the interaction
        between a Java application and a relational database. It provides an abstraction layer, allowing developers to work
        with Java objects instead of SQL queries to perform database operations. Hibernate offers a set of functionalities
        designed to streamline database access, improve productivity, and maintain code flexibility:

        ### ORM Mapping
            Hibernate enables developers to map Java objects (POJOs - Plain Old Java Objects) to database tables, allowing
            seamless interaction between Java code and relational databases. It uses annotations or XML mapping files to
            define these mappings.

        ### Database Independence
            Hibernate abstracts away the specific database implementation details, allowing applications to be more portable
            across different databases. Developers can write code using Hibernate without worrying about the underlying
            database intricacies.

        ### Automatic CRUD Operations
            Hibernate provides mechanisms to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on entities without
            having to write native SQL queries explicitly. It simplifies database interactions by using object-oriented
            methods and queries.

        ### HQL (Hibernate Query Language):
            Hibernate offers HQL, which is a powerful object-oriented query language similar to SQL but operates on entity
            objects and their properties. HQL queries are converted into SQL queries by Hibernate, allowing developers to
            work at an abstraction level closer to the application domain.

        ### Caching
            Hibernate includes various levels of caching mechanisms that enhance performance by storing frequently accessed
            data in memory. This reduces the number of database queries and improves application response time.

        ### Transaction Management
            It provides robust transaction management capabilities, ensuring data integrity and consistency by supporting
            ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties in transactions.

        ### Lazy Loading and Eager Loading
            Hibernate supports lazy loading, where related data is fetched from the database only when needed, and eager
            loading, where associated data is fetched immediately with the main entity.

        ### Integration with Java EE and Spring
            Hibernate integrates well with Java EE and Spring frameworks, offering seamless integration and allowing
            developers to leverage additional functionalities provided by these ecosystems.
